# Hackathon 2: Improve Smart City application

Valencia City Hall has already a control dashboard to visualize Valenbici stations status on real time. 
With this tool, they schedule bicycle movements to ensure availability, and also can do analytics to improve the network adding more slots or creating new stations. 

Here you can have high level architecture of the application provided.

## Setup

We are  going to use already provided ElasticStreaming Virtual Machine, but we need to configure it to use 6GB of RAM. 

* Start virtual machine and logon. 

* Open Web Browser and go to  http://console.cloud.google.com/

* Create a new project called hackathon and move to it.

* Go to pub/sub on left panel and create topic calling it valenbisi.

* Click to the topic already created go down and click on Create Subscription called streaming, left rest as default:

<br/>
<img src="./img/CreateSubscription2.png" width="75%">

* Donwload key to be able to consume and populate messages to pub/sub. 
	* Go to left panel to IAM & admin --> Service accounts
	* Click on Create Service  Account
	* Create service account called streaming, and click on Continue:<br/>

* Enable pub/sub API
	* Going to API & Services on left panel 
	* Click on Enable Apis & Services
	* Look for Pub/Sub and enable it. 

* Open a terminal and move the json key downloaded to Crendentials folder. Run the following:
```
cp Downloads/your_downloaded_credentials.json Credentials/mobilityApp.json
```  

* Edit /home/edem/bash.rc file commenting previous crendentials and adding this one as google application credentials:
```
#export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/home/edem/Credentials/iexCloudApp.json
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/home/edem/Credentials/mobilityApp.json
```


Create a directory to donwload the Mobility application. Run the following:
```
mkdir hackathon
cd hackathon
git clone https://github.com/rlopezherrero/GFT-EDEM-MasterData.git
```

* Install elastic module for python. Run the following:
```
pip install elasticsearch
```

## Run the platform

* Launch elasticsearch:
	* Open a terminal and run the following
	```
	Software/elasticsearch-7.4.2/bin/elasticsearch
	```  

* Launch kibana:
```
Software/kibana-7.4.2-linux-x86_64/bin/kibana
```  

* Open web browser to validate that kibana has been launched successfully --> http://localhost:5601

* Go to Dev Tools on left pannel and create a mapping for location geo point. 
```
PUT valenbisi
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "location": {
        "type": "geo_point"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

* Setup the Dashboards. Go to Management / Kibana (saved objects) / Import 
```
/home/edem/Exercises/hackathon/GFT-EDEM-MasterData/Hackathon/kibana/export.ndjson
```  


## Launching the application
